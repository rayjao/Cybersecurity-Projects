# SOC Analyst Lab Project

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a practical SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst lab environment designed to simulate real-world threat detection, analysis, and response scenarios. It is intended to showcase hands-on cybersecurity skills in log analysis, SIEM monitoring, alert triage, and incident response.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Set up and configure a SIEM environment (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack, or Wazuh)
- Collect and parse security logs from various sources (Windows/Linux, firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Create detection rules and alerts based on common attack patterns
- Analyze simulated security events and provide incident response steps
- Demonstrate threat intelligence integration and correlation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 💻 **SIEM**: [Elastic Stack (ELK)](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack), Splunk, or Wazuh
- 🔎 **Analysis**: Wireshark, Sysmon, Windows Event Viewer
- 🚨 **Detection**: Sigma rules, YARA rules
- 🌐 **Threat Intel**: VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX
- 📁 **Log Sources**: Windows Logs, Zeek logs, Suricata alerts, Syslog

## 🧪 Use Case Scenarios

1. **Phishing Email Investigation**
2. **Lateral Movement Detection**
3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**
4. **Brute Force Login Attempt**
5. **Data Exfiltration via DNS Tunneling**

## 📊 Sample Dashboards

> Include screenshots or links if you’ve created dashboards in Kibana, Splunk, or Grafana.

## 📝 Report Samples

> Attach or reference incident response reports written during the lab simulations, highlighting TTPs, IOCs, and remediation steps.

## 📂 Project Structure

To replicate the lab setup:
1. Install and configure [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html)
2. Forward logs using Winlogbeat/Packetbeat/Filebeat
3. Use sample attack data from [Red Team Simulation tools](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)
4. Create and test detection rules
5. Analyze alerts in the SIEM
